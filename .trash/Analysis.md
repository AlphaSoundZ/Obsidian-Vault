The book “A Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass: An American Slave”, which was written by Frederick Douglass himself and published in 1845 deals the life of Frederick Douglass as a slave, who managed to learn to read and write although it was illegal for a slave. When Douglass was twenty-one, he escaped from slavery and made his way to Massachusetts, where he joined the abolitionist movement and began making powerful speeches against slavery. The author makes the use of multiple stylistic devices such as metaphers, repetitions and comparisons to convey the inhumane living conditions he faced as a slave.

First, the author uses the stylistic device of metaphor to show how it feels to be trapped as a slave and how much he wished to be free. In line 10, he says “a prayer to god for deliverance from his chains”. The “chains” keep him trapped and bound to his owner.

- metaphor: line 10 “deliverance from his chains” → it means that he wants freedom, so isnt trapped as a slave anymore
- comparison: line 14 “I was leased to my master’s relative” → being treatened as an object
- metaphor: line 23 f. “I was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery”
- repetition: line 29 “Work, work, work” always work without breaks at day and night
- rhyme: line 31: “from the first approach of the day till its last lingering ray” → the whole day was used to work, not a minute is wasted, makes the sentence more rememberal, it gets highlighted, focus on specific words
- comparison: line 37 “his discipline tamed me” → comparison with an animal
- enumeration: line 38 - 40: “My natural elasticity was crushed, my intellect languished, my desire to read departed, the cheerful spark that lingered about my eye died”
