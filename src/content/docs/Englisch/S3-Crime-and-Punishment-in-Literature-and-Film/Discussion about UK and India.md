## Task

Discuss whether the UK should pay reparations to India. Also consider the question of fairness: Do today’s citizens of any country owe anything to the descendants of those their ancestors mistreated, exploited or killed? If so, what do they owe them?


- **Imperial History Perspective:**
  - Empires, including the British and Mughal, pursued policies that primarily benefited the rulers.
  - India's history includes imperial formations where people were dominated for the benefit of rulers.

- **Economic Impact:**
  - European industrialization was a significant factor in the global shift of power.
  - Destruction of Indian "craft production" was not unique to British rule; it happened worldwide with industrialization.
  - The development of Indian railways and other infrastructure had potential economic benefits.

- **Cultural and Educational Contributions:**
  - The British introduced Western-style universities, press, and a publishing sector in India.
  - English as a unifying language was offered, contributing to the survival of Indian democracy.
  - The construction of New Delhi as a capital was a substantial investment.

- **Industrial Competition and Impact:**
  - Indian industrialization, especially in jute manufacturing, competed and succeeded against British equivalents.
  - British actions, including unifying princely states, contributed to the overall unification of India.

- **Global Economic Shifts:**
  - India's decline in its share of world GDP between 1800 and 1947 was influenced by global economic shifts, not solely British rule.

- **Reparations as Impractical:**
  - Reparations are deemed impractical, citing difficulties in calculation, payment, and ensuring distribution to the poorer segments of society.
  - Precedents, like Berlusconi's agreement with Gaddafi, are considered ill omens for reparations.

- **Atonement and Moving Forward:**
  - Atonement for historical wrongs should come through academic writings, awareness, and guarding against modern forms of exploitation.
  - Economic growth and improvements should result from aid, support, fair and free trade rather than reparations.

- **Symbolism of the Koh-i-Noor Diamond:**
  - The use of the Koh-i-Noor diamond as an example is seen as symbolic of unproductive aspects of Hinduism and the power of earlier Indian elites.
