- Growing trend of acknowledging Indigenous traditional lands in Canada before events
- Aimed at recognizing historical presence and treaties
- Variation in acknowledgments based on location and diverse Indigenous groups
- Challenges include defining "traditional" and debates over inclusion of specific Indigenous groups
- Criticism of Canada's hypocrisy in addressing historical mistreatment, citing instances like the Muskrat Falls project
- Shift in focus from "What's wrong with them?" to "What's wrong with us?"
- Suggestions to make acknowledgments more genuine, reflecting the multicultural contradiction – every refugee is also a settler.
