# Discussion Malcolm Vs Martin Luther King

Arguments

- it may not be practical or effective in certain situations
    - personal experience in sit-ins and other protests

### Protests

One example is the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which began in 1955 after Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white person. The boycott lasted for over a year and resulted in the Supreme Court ruling that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional, but it did not end segregation in other areas such as education, housing and public facilities.

### Arguments against Malcolm

- Malcolm X advocated for Black separatism, which I think, does not undermined the goal of integration and equal rights for Black Americans.
- I believe in self-respect â†’ not attacking other people
