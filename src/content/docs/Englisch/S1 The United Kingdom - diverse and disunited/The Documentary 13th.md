# The Documentary 13th

### Analyse how the Documentary Portrays the Influence of the Media and Technology

The documentary 13th, directed by Ava DuVernay, explores the history of racial inequality in the United States, with a specific focus on the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude. The film examines how the amendment has been interpreted and applied over time, and how it has been used to justify the mass incarceration of Black Americans.

One of the key themes in the documentary is the role of media and technology in shaping public perception and understanding of issues related to race and criminal justice. The film argues that media representations of Black people have been used to justify discrimination and violence, and that technology has been used to surveil, control, and punish Black communities.

For example, the documentary shows how images of Black people as criminals and violent have been used to justify discriminatory policies and practices, such as the War on Drugs, which disproportionately targeted Black communities. The film also explores how technology, such as surveillance cameras, has been used to monitor and control Black people, and how the criminal justice system has used technology to collect data on and track Black Americans.

Overall, the documentary 13th portrays the influence of media and technology as a powerful tool for shaping public perception and understanding of racial issues, and how it can be used to justify discrimination and violence against marginalized communities, specifically black Americans.
