| Which different ways there are in which an oppressed group can fight their oppression | 1. rise up in the open violence (self-defense, self-defense is a last resort and should not be the primary means of resistance)
2. organized non-violence resistance
3. resignation of acquiescence (Verzicht auf Zustimmung) |

| Whether violence is an appropriate form of resistance in cases of particularly strong oppression | Violence is appropriate if it is the only alternative to fear, but it isn’t the only alternative. According to Martin Luther King Jr., non-violence is the most appropriate and powerful form of resistance in cases of strong oppression. |
| How non-violence relates to strength and weakness | King believed that nonviolence is a form of strength that is rooted in moral conviction, and that it is a powerful way to achieve change and overcome oppression without becoming oppressors themselves. The weak persons persons who don't have the weapons of violence persons, are free. |
| Whether there is a difference between non-violent resistance and passive resistance | If passive resistance means passively accepting violence or injustice (cowardice = Feigheit), then there is a difference because non-violent resistance means being passive physically but active spiritually. |
| How non-violent resistance relates to the teachings of Christianity | Martin Luther King Jr. believed that non-violent resistance was closely aligned with the teachings of Christianity. He believed that the principles of love, forgiveness, and redemption that are central to Christianity could be applied to the civil rights movement to achieve change through non-violent means. |
| Why Martin Luther King Jr. supports the intervention of armed police in Little Rock, Arkansas despite his doctrine of nonviolence | Martin Luther King Jr. believed in using nonviolent tactics to achieve civil rights for African Americans, but he also believed in using the laws and government institutions to achieve change. In the case of Little Rock, Arkansas, where nine African American students were trying to integrate a previously all-white high school, King supported the intervention of federal troops to protect the students' right to attend the school. |

### Malcolm X’s Approach to Fighting Oppression

Malcolm X's approach to fighting oppression was based on a more militant, self-reliant, and separate-minded strategy, and he advocated for the use of whatever means necessary including violence and international pressure, to achieve civil rights for African Americans.
