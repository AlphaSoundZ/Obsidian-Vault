# Characterization

Carole is the protagonist of the first section in Chapter 2 of the novel „Girl, Woman, Other”. Carole can be described as a smart, optimistic and romantic person who loves her job as a financial executive. She likes dancing and going on parties.

Carole is an intelligent person, what can be explained by taking a look at her hobbies and interests. At a young age already, she has interest in math and loves knowing things which her classmates do not unterstand. One evidence can be found in page 122 „how she loved memorizing the quadratic equation, when her classmates didn’t even know what it is”. In addition her job as a financial executive and later then vice president of a bank connects to her interest in math. The promotions make clear, that she is really good at what she is doing (p. 144).
Carole likes to be romantic what one can see by her boyfriend Freddy, who is also romantic, intelligent (p. 148). 
Regarding to the location where she first met her boyfriend Freddy and her love to dancing, it shows that she likes to go on parties (p. 147). 
On the other side of her personality, being raped at an age of 13 causes trust issues, fear and trauma (p. 132). Besides she hides her problems by acting normal but feeling herself swaying (p. 114). In addition she feels unwell, out of place and out of her depth (p. 132). But she is optimistic and makes improvements of the situation „these days, however, she feels very much more alive, very much ‘looking forward’  […]”.

There would be a conclusion in the end.
