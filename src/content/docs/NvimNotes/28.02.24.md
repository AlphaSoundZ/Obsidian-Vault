- Compare intersection with every other factor (except it already intersected with it in this combination)
- In the beginning the intersection is the whole set of the first factor
- We remove the factor from the factorList after it intersected with all other factors (so after each round)
- The rounds are finished when the factorList is empty

# Recursive Algorithm

## Each Round:

- (1) We compare the intersection with each factor
  - For each factor we compare the intersection with the factor
    - If the intersection is empty -> continue;
    - Else: Move to (1) with the new intersection
