## Studying Tips

- Flashcards (Anki)
- The harder it is for the brain, the better it can remember
	- Instead of summarizing while reading, read the whole thing and try to write as much as you can remember
- Do the hard/brain work in your most productive time period (in the morning)

## Time Blocking[^1]

1. Do not have a hard start-time and end-time (the end- and start-time buffer is a time where you have the ability to work). If you try to work for a specific time, you try to get over it, instead of if your work for an unspecific time, you try to finish the task
2. Stop when you feel tired or feel that you’ve learned enough!
3. Don’t back-to-back tasks (switching between tasks)
4. Don’t schedule specific tasks
5. Learn and use your body clock (I think for me it’s in the morning)

## Taking Notes During Lecture[^2]

- Only write down questions you have
- Highlight and Comment in the Presentation Slides
