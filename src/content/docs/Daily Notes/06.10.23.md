### Aufgabe 1

Hi Rachel,

just watched the episode „A Scandal in Bohemia”, was quite nice, but different… really different. In addition I found an interesting article about Sherlock Holmes in another mini-series. The article is written in German, so here is a quick sum up:


Now my answer to whether you should watch it:
If you would like a modernization of the original story, then the film adaptation could be nice. If you rather like a one to one adaptation then you’ll not find what you are looking for with this adaptation.

Best regards!
