##### Summary of Facts

On September 4, 2023, at approximately 22 pm, officers from our department responded to a report of a suspicious incident. A neighbor had reported hearing a shriek, whereupon he suspected foul play. The suspect showed erratic and irrational behavior during the investigation. He claimed that the scream came from him in a bad dream and that the victim was not in the house, although eventually the dismembered body of the victim was found in the bedroom.

The suspect showed signs of panic, paranoia and extreme nervousness, which raised doubts about his possible involvement in the crime. Due to his panic and paranoia, the suspect uncovered the body parts and confessed to the murder. The victim was hidden under three floorboards of the bedroom floor. The head, arms and legs were separated from the torso.

The motive for this horrific act remains unclear, as the suspect has not provided any plausible explanation for his actions.
