# Tea Time

Hello everyone, today I would like to talk about tea time.

### History

The tradition of tea time was started by Anna, the 7th Duchess of Bedford, who was said to have suffered from "afternoon slump" and found comfort in taking a light meal along with tea. This quickly caught on among the upper classes and eventually became a widely accepted social event.

You might have heard of Afternoon Tea, High Tea or even something called Elevenses. But what are they exactly? Here's a short primer on the three English tea times:

### **Elevenses**

Elevenses is, surprise, tea served around 11 in the morning and is a late-morning work break that involves a light snack, like muffins, scones or biscuits - and a hot tea or coffee.

### **High Tea**

High Tea, despite its name, actually began with the lower classes. For workers in the newly industrialized Britain, tea time had to wait until after work. This after-work meal was more often hot and filling and accompanied by a pot of strong tea.

### **Afternoon Tea**

Calling it "high tea" may have been a way to differentiate it between afternoon tea traditionally served on low, comfortable, relaxing chairs and the worker's after-work tea served at the table and seated on high back dining chairs.

Afternoon Tea originated as a "bridge" between the light lunches and late dinners served in the early 1800s. Afternoon Tea usually occurs between 3 and 4 pm. It's an elaborate affair with finger sandwiches and an array of scones, cakes, macaroons and other bits to nibble.

Tea time offers an opportunity to take a break, relax, and catch up with friends and family. It's also a time to enjoy a variety of teas, from traditional black tea to more exotic blends like green tea or chai. The food served during tea time is usually light and bite-sized, making it perfect for snacking or a pre-dinner treat. 

All in all, tea time is a British tradition that dates back to the mid-17th century. It is a time for taking a break from the day and enjoying a cup of tea along with light snacks such as sandwiches and pastries. Tea time is usually taken in the afternoon, between 3 and 4 pm, but there are also other tea times.

Thank you for listening.
