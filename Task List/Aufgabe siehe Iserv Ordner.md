## Examine how the author tries to convince the reader of his view.

The author attempts to convince the reader of his view by:

- Citing an Opiniom poll that revealed that ethnic minority British people feel less British since the EU referendum
- Noting that many of the country's iconic cultural traditions are the products of immigration and in combination providing examples for the main claim (ll. 79 - 86)
    - fish and chips
    - innovation of Jewish refugees from Portugal
    - Roads and cities were built by the Romans
    - banks were founded by Huguenots
    - a royal household established by a broad cross-section of European aristocracy
    - There were Africans in Britain, it‚Äôs now widely accepted, before there were any ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù
- Suggesting that the current context of patriotism should be viewed with apprehension, as it is demonising visible minorities and attempting to regress to a time before the European Union.
- Stylistic devices
    - Emotive language, such as "hostile (=feindseelig)", "sinister (=b√∂se)", and "malign (=b√∂sartig)"
    - Appealing to the reader's sense of patriotism as a motivation to challenge the current context of hostility (last lines)
    - Juxtaposition: The first paragraph juxtaposes the wave of nostalgia sweeping political discourse in modern Britain with the supposed humanitarianism that accompanied the age of empire.

In the article Afua Hirsch claims that ethnic minorities are a part of British culture. The author's attempt to convince the reader of her view is based on a combination of opinion based evidence, facts, examples and stylistic devices.

The author cites an Opiniom poll which reveals that ethnic minority British people feel less British since the EU referendum. This serves to demonstrate the current hostility towards visible minorities and to emphasise the importance of challenging the current context of patriotism.

The author also provides examples of iconic British cultural traditions which are the products of immigration. These examples include: fish and chips, innovation of Jewish refugees from Portugal, roads and cities built by the Romans, banks founded by Huguenots, and a royal household established by a broad cross-section of European aristocracy. This serves to strengthen the author's claim that British culture is a product of immigration, and to challenge the current context of patriotism which is demonising visible minorities and attempting to regress to a time before the European Union.

Finally, the author employs several stylistic devices in order to convince the reader of his view. These include emotive language such as "hostile", "sinister" and "malign", as well as appealing to the reader's sense of patriotism and juxtaposing the wave of nostalgia sweeping political discourse in modern Britain with the supposed humanitarianism that accompanied the age of empire.
